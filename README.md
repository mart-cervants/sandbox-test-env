# Data Engineering Sandbox (Test & Planning Environment)

This repo is intended to test and planning different options (tools & technologies) during the development of the Sandbox Data Engineering project to specify a clear path.

The first stage for the Sandbox Test Environment will include three layers: 
1. Data Source 
2. Ingestion
3. Data Storage 


## Steps to replicate
Clone the github repository and locate yourself in `sandbox-test-env` directory.

To import the modules used in the environment add the following env variable:

`export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/workspace`

Sample variable used:

`export PYTHONPATH=/home/martinalejandr/sandbox-test-env`

Go to To run the program use the following command:

`python3 ./main/main.py`

## TODO
1. Clean & refactor the code.
